/**
 * @module utils/swrCache
 * @description Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR) in-memory cache layer.
 * Provides high-availability fallback by returning stale data with a
 * degraded signal while transparently updating from upstream in the
 * background.
 *
 * Capacity is bounded via an LRU eviction policy configurable through
 * the {@link SWRCacheOptions.maxEntries | maxEntries} constructor option.
 * The cache map's insertion order is the source of truth: every {@link
 * SWRCache.get | get} call that hits an existing entry, and every write via
 * the internal setter, performs a delete-then-set so the entry is treated
 * as most-recently-used. When the cache exceeds the configured cap, the
 * insertion-order-oldest entry is purged until cap is satisfied.
 *
 * Eviction never blocks or corrupts in-flight coalesced revalidations:
 * `activeFetches` is tracked independently of cache membership and any
 * promise already pending resolves with the data it was awaiting.
 *
 * Background revalidation errors are routed through the structured logger
 * (see {@link logger}) and an optional {@link SWRCacheOptions.onRevalidationError |
 * onRevalidationError} callback, so operators can aggregate or alert on
 * wedged caches. The cache never propagates background errors to callers;
 * stale data continues to be served.

/**
 * Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR) cache implementation with bounded LRU eviction.
 *
 * Provides high-availability fallback by returning stale data with a degraded signal
 * while transparently updating from upstream in the background. Supports coalesced
 * concurrent requests to prevent upstream stampedes.
 *
 * ### Key Behaviors
 * - **Fresh hit**: If the cached entry's age is less than `ttlMs`, the cached value is returned immediately without calling the upstream fetcher.
 * - **Stale hit**: If the cached entry's age is between `ttlMs` and `ttlMs + swrMs`, the stale cached value is returned immediately (with `degraded: true`) and a background revalidation fetch is triggered exactly once.
 * - **Cache miss**: If no cached entry exists or it has completely expired (age >= `ttlMs + swrMs`), the cache blocks and awaits the upstream fetcher to populate the entry.
 * - **Request coalescing**: Concurrent cache misses or concurrent stale hits for the same key are coalesced into a single upstream fetch, preventing cache stampedes.
 * - **Error handling**: Failed background revalidations swallow the rejection to avoid throwing to stale callers, logging a message via `console.error` while the stale cached value is retained. Initial fetch failures or completely expired cache misses propagate their rejections to callers.
 * - **LRU Eviction**: Bounded via a configurable capacity (`maxEntries`). Insertion-ordered Map tracking ensures the least-recently-used entry is evicted when the cap is exceeded.
 *
 * ### Testing with Fake Timers
 * When unit testing code that uses `SWRCache`, control time deterministically with Jest fake timers:
 * ```typescript
 * beforeEach(() => {
 *   jest.useFakeTimers();
 * });
 * afterEach(() => {
 *   jest.useRealTimers();
 * });
 * // To simulate TTL expiration:
 * jest.advanceTimersByTime(ttlMs + 10);
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const cache = new SWRCache({ maxEntries: 1000 });
 * const result = await cache.get('user:123', fetchUser, { ttlMs: 5000, swrMs: 30000 });
 * if (result.degraded) {
 *   // Data is stale but available immediately; background refresh has been triggered.
 * }
 * ```
